# Testing

## Goals

- Prove correctness of parsers, validation, and planning logic.
- Keep tests deterministic: normalize timestamps, random identifiers, and unstable ordering before golden comparisons.
- Fail CI on regressions in rule loading, OpenAPI extraction, and public HTTP contracts.

## Layers

| Layer | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| Unit | Rule validation, OpenAPI `ExtractEndpointSpecs`, path template helper, V1 planner, mutation generator, `internal/diff/v1` matchers, `internal/executil` redaction, mutation `BuildRequest` scope checks. |
| Handler | Scan create, control, OpenAPI, PATCH scan, executions list/detail, baseline/mutations contract cases using `httptest` and in-memory repository fakes (no database). |
| Baseline | `internal/executor/baseline/runner_test` uses `httptest` plus in-memory store; performs one GET baseline. |
| Integration | `internal/storage/postgres` when `AXIOM_TEST_DATABASE_URL` is set (runs `dbmigrate.Up` from `AXIOM_TEST_MIGRATIONS_DIR` or `./migrations`, including `000004` for mutation or finding columns). |
| End-to-end | Full scan with findings against a live target (future). |

## Fixtures

Store OpenAPI snippets and HTTP transcripts under a dedicated `testdata` tree (to be expanded). Remove volatile headers and dates when diffing responses.

## Running tests

```text
go test ./...
go vet ./...
```

The module `go` directive may require a newer toolchain than 1.22; use the version named in `go.mod`.

PostgreSQL-backed tests live in `internal/storage/postgres`. They apply **all** migrations from `migrations/` (including `000004_mutation_findings`) via `internal/dbmigrate` on each run. Required environment variable:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `AXIOM_TEST_DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL URL for a database the tests may migrate (use a dedicated test database, not production). |

Optional:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `AXIOM_TEST_MIGRATIONS_DIR` | Path to migrations directory (default: `migrations` relative to the process working directory). |

Run only the postgres package (recommended after schema changes):

```text
export AXIOM_TEST_DATABASE_URL='postgres://USER:PASS@HOST:PORT/DBNAME?sslmode=disable'
cd /path/to/axiom-api-scanner
go test ./internal/storage/postgres/... -count=1 -v
```

Example with Docker (ephemeral server, empty database `axiom_verify`):

**Prerequisites:** the Docker daemon must be running (`docker info` shows a healthy Server section, not `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon`). On macOS, start Docker Desktop first. If you already have PostgreSQL listening elsewhere, skip Docker and set `AXIOM_TEST_DATABASE_URL` to that DSN instead.

```text
docker rm -f axiom-pg-test 2>/dev/null || true
docker run -d --name axiom-pg-test -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=test -e POSTGRES_DB=axiom_verify -p 54333:5432 postgres:16-alpine
# wait until the server accepts connections (e.g. a few seconds), then:
export AXIOM_TEST_DATABASE_URL='postgres://postgres:test@127.0.0.1:54333/axiom_verify?sslmode=disable'
go test ./internal/storage/postgres/... -count=1 -v
```

Migrations run in order through the latest file (currently `000004_mutation_findings`); `dbmigrate.Up` stops on the first apply error.

Integration tests: `TestScanLifecycle_integration`, `TestEndpointReplace_integration`, `TestFindingWrite_integration`. They are skipped when `AXIOM_TEST_DATABASE_URL` is unset.

Makefile helper if defined (see [development.md](development.md)):

```text
make test-integration
```

Linting:

```text
make lint
```

## Evidence normalization

When comparing responses, strip or replace fields such as `Date`, `X-Request-Id`, and server-specific tokens. Document normalization rules next to golden files when they are introduced.
